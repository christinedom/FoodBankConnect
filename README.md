# Project README  

## Project Setup Prompts  

- **Canvas / Slack group number:**  
  55085_07 

- **Names of the team members:**  
  - Odin Limaye 
  - Francisco Vivas
  - Christine Dominic
  - Mahika Dawar
  - Jose Lopez
  

- **Name of the project:**  
  FoodBankConnect  

- **The proposed project:**  
  Our project will provide a hub where underserved communities can find nearby food banks and programs, while volunteers and donors can discover ways to contribute their time, and/or money. We'll have real-time food bank listings, distribution programs, and volunteer/donor opportunities.

- **URLs of at least three data sources that you will programmatically scrape (at least one must be a RESTful API):**  
  1. https://developer.volunteermatch.org/  
  2. https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/find-food  
  3. https://www.austintexas.gov/department/food-access  

- **At least three models:**  
  1. Food Banks / Pantries  
  2. Programs (Distributions, Meal Services, Nutrition Classes)  
  3. Volunteers / Donors  

- **An estimate of the number of instances of each model:**  
  - Food Banks / Pantries: ~200  
  - Programs: ~500  
  - Volunteers / Donors: ~1,000  

- **Each model must have many attributes. Describe five of those attributes for each model that will be on the cards and that you can filter or sort by:**  

  **Food Banks / Pantries**  
  1. Name  
  2. Location (city, zip)  
  3. Capacity (meals served per week)  
  4. Hours of operation  
  5. Urgency level (high/medium/low need)  

  **Programs**  
  1. Program type (distribution, class, service)  
  2. Eligibility (open, income-based, referral-based)  
  3. Frequency (weekly, monthly, one-time)  
  4. Cost (free, sliding scale, fixed fee)  
  5. Sponsor (nonprofit, city, church, etc.)  

  **Volunteers / Donors**  
  1. Name  
  2. Contribution type (time, money, skills)  
  3. Availability (days/hours)  
  4. Skills (cooking, logistics, language)  
  5. Past involvement (events volunteered/donated to)  

- **Instances of each model must connect to instances of at least two other models:**  
  - Food Banks connect to Programs and Volunteers/Donors  
  - Programs connect to Food Banks and Volunteers/Donors  
  - Volunteers/Donors connect to Food Banks and Programs  

- **Instances of each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc.). Describe two types of media for each model:**  
  - Food Banks: photos, maps of their locations 
  - Programs: flyer images, videos of nutrition classes  
  - Volunteers/Donors: profile photos, donation receipts or volunteer certificates  

- **Describe three questions that your site will answer:**  
  1. Which food banks near me are most in need right now?  
  2. What food distribution programs or classes are happening this week?  
  3. How can I contribute (donate or volunteer) to help underserved communities?
