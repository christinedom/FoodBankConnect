- **Names of the team members:**  
  - Odin Limaye  
  - Francisco Vivas  
  - Christine Dominic  
  - Mahika Dawar  
  - Jose Lopez  

- **Name of the project:**  
  FoodBankConnect  

- **The proposed project:**  
  Our project will provide a hub where underserved communities can find nearby food banks and programs, while sponsors and donors can discover ways to contribute resources. We'll have real-time food bank listings, distribution programs, classes, and volunteer opportunities, as well as donor and sponsor connections.  

- **URLs of at least three data sources that you will programmatically scrape (at least one must be a RESTful API):**  
  1. https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide  
  2. https://mealconnect.docs.apiary.io/#
  3. https://www.givefood.org.uk/api/
  4. https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/food-assistance/get-food-now  
  5. https://www.austintexas.gov/page/get-help-food-access-today  
  6. https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api  
  7. https://www.findhelp.org

- **At least three models:**  
  1. Food Banks and Food Pantries  
  2. Programs/Services (Distributions, Meal Services, Nutrition Classes, Volunteer Opportunities)  
  3. Sponsors/Donors  

- **An estimate of the number of instances of each model:**  
  - Food Banks and Food Pantries: ~200  
  - Programs/Services: ~700
  - Sponsors/Donors: ~700  

- **Each model must have many attributes. Describe five of those attributes for each model that will be on the cards and that you can filter or sort by:**  

  **Food Banks / Pantries**  
  1. Name  
  2. Location (city, zip)  
  3. Capacity (meals served per week)  
  4. Hours of operation  
  5. Urgency level  

  **Programs (including Volunteer Opportunities)**  
  1. Program type (distribution, class, service, volunteer)  
  2. Eligibility (open, income-based, referral-based)  
  3. Frequency (weekly, monthly, one-time)  
  4. Cost (free, sliding scale, fixed fee)  
  5. Host organization (nonprofit, city, church, etc.)  

  **Sponsors / Donors**  
  1. Name of organization
  2. Contribution type (money, food, supplies)  
  3. Contribution amount  
  4. Affiliation (corporate, nonprofit, individual)  
  5. Past involvement (events or food banks supported)  

- **Instances of each model must connect to instances of at least two other models:**  
  - Food Banks connect to Programs and Sponsors/Donors  
  - Programs connect to Food Banks and Sponsors/Donors  
  - Sponsors/Donors connect to Food Banks and Programs  

- **Instances of each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc.). Describe two types of media for each model:**  
  - Food Banks: photos of the bank, maps of their locations (link to Google Maps)
  - Programs: flyer images, videos of nutrition classes or volunteer events  
  - Sponsors/Donors: photos of donor logos, text describing their contributions

- **Describe three questions that your site will answer:**  
  1. Which food banks near me are most in need right now?  
  2. What food distribution programs, classes, or volunteer opportunities are happening this week?  
  3. Which organizations or sponsors are supporting local food banks and in what ways?
