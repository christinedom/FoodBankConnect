            <p>
                This site's purpose is to connect volunteers, donors, and food
                banks in order to increase their ability to work with one
                another to achieve the common goal of alleviating hunger in
                impoverished communities. We want food banks to be able to
                increase their visibility so that people in need of their
                services know about them and what they offer. This site also
                allows food banks to increase their volunteer and sponsor
                numbers by displaying relevant information to those fields. We
                want people looking to volunteer to be able to find a multitude
                of programs and opportunities in which they can enroll. Lastly,
                we want possible sponsors and donors to find organizations
                towards which they can put funding and support. <br /><br />

            <h2 class="mt-4">Tools Used</h2>
            <p>
                GitLab:<br>
                We used GitLab as our method of source control and collaborative integration. We used GitLab's 
                Continous Integration features to manage our code's organization, structure, and functionality. 
                Our GitLab repo also automatically deploys to our hosting service due to our build configuration.<br><br>
                Bootstrap:<br>
                We used Bootstrap as our CSS framework, mainly making use of its pre-made objects such as navigational 
                bars, buttons, and tables. We also used Boostrap's formatting tools to create consistently styled headers,
                paragraphs, and text boxes.<br><br>
                Amazon Web Services:<br>
                We used AWS to host our site on its CloudFront platform, using its S3 bucket structure to manage our static 
                web pages. We also used AWS to obtain our SSL certificate, allowing our site to trasnfer data through HTTPS.<br><br>
                Namecheap:<br>
                We used Namecheap to obtain our domain name and to verify our SSL certificate. We also currently use Namecheap
                to redirect HTTP and www sub-domain calls to the standard HTTPS version of our site.
