        <p>
          This site's purpose is to connect volunteers, donors, and food
          banks in order to increase their ability to work with one
          another to achieve the common goal of alleviating hunger in
          impoverished communities. We want food banks to be able to
          increase their visibility so that people in need of their
          services know about them and what they offer. This site also
          allows food banks to increase their volunteer and sponsor
          numbers by displaying relevant information to those fields. We
          want people looking to volunteer to be able to find a multitude
          of programs and opportunities in which they can enroll. Lastly,
          we want possible sponsors and donors to find organizations
          towards which they can direct funding and support. <br /><br />

        <h2 className="mt-5">Integrating Disparate Data</h2>
        <p>
          We saw some interesting results in regards to integrating the disparate models together on our site, both in the 
          front and back ends of our website. Since the three different models are related, we noticed a decent amount 
          of overlap when comparing common attributes and similar data fields. However, each model was just unique enough to 
          exhibit its own behavior and attributes that the other models did not share. For example, all the models have a sense 
          of location - where the food bank is located, where the program is taking place, where the sponsor is headquartered. But, 
          a sponsor wouldn't have a sign-up link like a program would, and a food bank wouldn't have an employee identification 
          number with the IRS like the charitable donors would. This led to Venn-diagram-esque overlap of commonalities and differences
          between data of the three different models.

        <h2 className="mt-4">Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>GitLab:</strong><br />
          We used GitLab as our method of source control and collaborative integration. We used GitLab's Continuous
          Integration features to manage our code's organization, structure, and functionality. Our GitLab repo also
          automatically deploys to our hosting service due to our build configuration.<br /><br />
          <strong>Amazon Web Services:</strong><br />
          We used AWS to host our site on its CloudFront platform, using its S3 bucket structure to manage our static web
          pages. We also used AWS to obtain our SSL certificate, allowing our site to transfer data through HTTPS.<br /><br />
          <strong>Namecheap:</strong><br />
          We used Namecheap to obtain our domain name and to verify our SSL certificate. We also currently use Namecheap
          to redirect HTTP and www sub-domain calls to the standard HTTPS version of our site.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4">Optional Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Bootstrap:</strong><br />
          We used Bootstrap as our CSS framework, mainly making use of its pre-made objects such as navigational bars,
          buttons, and tables. We also used Bootstrap's formatting tools to create consistently styled headers,
          paragraphs, and text boxes.<br /><br />
        </p>
          <strong>React:</strong><br />
          We used React as the central framework for the front-end of our website, using it to create components 
          and templates in our dynamic instance page and model page card generation. We also made use of React's routing
          to organize the interconnected links within our site with the correct variable passing.<br /><br />
        <p>
          <strong>Beautiful Soup:</strong><br />
          We used the Beautiful Soup library for Python to aid us in our web scraping when populating our database. This 
          library provided helpful tools and objects for reading from HTML pages and navigating among the various sections 
          in these HTML files.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Google Cloud API:</strong><br />
          We made use of Google Cloud's programmatic search engine API in order to have our web scrapers be able to query
          Google's search engine in order to search for images, logos, and website links related to our instances.
