		about: `Trader Joe's is a national chain of grocery stores known for
            offering high-quality products at affordable prices. To keep costs
            low, Trader Joe's often buys directly from suppliers whenever
            possible and avoids charging fees for shelf placement, allowing
            savings to be passed on to customers. 
            The company is also committed to reducing food waste through its
            Neighborhood Shares Program, which donates unsold but safe-to-eat
            food to local food banks and non-profit organizations, supporting
            communities across the country.`,

            Austin. Since then, the franchise has expanded to several locations,
            including San Marcos and even as far as Columbus, Ohio. Dragon's Lair
            Comics and Fantasy is a specialty store that sells comics, games,
            manga, plush toys, action figures, and other pop culture
            collectibles.
            Twice a year, Dragon's Lair hosts a semi-annual food drive called
            CanMander for the Hope Food Pantry, donating roughly 1,200 pounds of
            canned food each year. The store also partners with and supports other
            community organizations, including CASA, AIDS Walk Austin, and Hill
            Country Ride for AIDS.`,

		about: `The Trinity Church of Austin originally began in 1946, then known as
            Trinity Methodist Church, as a project to attract more youth to the
            area north of 45th Street. Over the years, Trinity became a welcoming
            community known for its inclusivity and commitment to social justice.
            The church is dually affiliated with both the United Methodist Church
            (UMC) and the United Church of Christ (UCC), reflecting its open and
            progressive values.
            The Trinity Church of Austin also founded the Hope Food Pantry and has
            continued to house and support it for the past 20 years, serving
            countless families in need throughout the Austin community.`,
